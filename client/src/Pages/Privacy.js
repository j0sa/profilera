                We will only hold data about you for as long as necessary,

                To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data,
                we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal
                data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or
                disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we
                process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
                purposes through other means, and the applicable legal
                requirements.

                those risks might pose to the rights and freedoms of our Website

                safeguards may include standard data protection clauses adopted
                by a data protection regulator and approved by the European
                Commission, such as the European Commission’s standard
                contractual clauses, or other appropriate measures.
