          <p>
            {" "}
            Customer segmentation is the process by which you divide your
            customer base based on common characteristics â€“ such as behaviors,
            income, age, location and interests. This is done in order to market
            to those customers more effectively.
          </p>

          <p>
            The groups that form as a result of customer segmentation can also
            be used to create a marketing persona. A marketing persona is a
            fictive person that is made up of the traits that in this case is in
            common for a group of customers. This is because customer
            segmentation is typically used to improve how a business sells and
            so marketing personas need to be closely aligned with these customer
            segments in order to provide a better understanding of which
            marketing methods are best suited for the persona. For each group
            created as a result of customer segmentation a specifikt persona is
            created to represent each one of these groups.
